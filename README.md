This is a project I completed as a student at [hackreactor](http://hackreactor.com). This project was worked on with a pair.

Bees - get ready to learn some science, and ES6
Bees (the most noble of insects) progress through specific developmental stages over the course of their lifetimes. Each phase has specific traits and behaviors associated with it that are unique to that lifestage. In this repo, you will create bees of many lifestages while practicing the new class syntax that ES6 instatiation pattern, inheritance, and subclassing.

Class Structure
├── Grub

│   └── Bee

│       ├── HoneyMakerBee

│       └── ForagerBee

│          └── RetiredForagerBee


As you can see in the diagram above, all bees start out as a Grub, grow into a Bee and are then assigned its specific jobs and tasks among its other charactersitics. This means that characteristics are inherited from the classes above (although they can be modified on the current class level).
